# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving **E‑Core: Robot Heart**!

## How to contribute
1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-thing`
2. **Run tests/sim** (if you touch firmware or tools).
3. **Write docs** for user‑visible changes.
4. **Open a PR** with a clear description, screenshots/plots if relevant.

## Coding style
- Firmware: C++17, prefer small, testable modules.
- Python tools: type hints when reasonable, black/flake8 style.
- Keep the **always‑on budget** in mind; avoid sneaky background work.

## Commit messages
- Use imperative style: `Add energy homeostasis scheduler`

## Issue labels
- `firmware`, `hardware`, `docs`, `simulation`, `good-first-issue`
