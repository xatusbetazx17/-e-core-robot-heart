# Safety Notes

- **No weapons.** This project focuses on safe, civilian robotics power.
- **Batteries:** Never recharge Li‑SOCl₂. Use correct protection and ideal diodes.
- **Thermals:** Watch surface temps with TEGs and in sealed enclosures.
- **Isolation:** Prefer contactless pads to avoid corroded/exposed contacts.
- **EMC/ESD:** TVS/ESD diodes on external lines; shielding where appropriate.
